    "description": "This pattern demonstrates the basic principle of the patterns program. A pattern is composed of a repeating \"motif\". The various proprties of that motif may be varied - each independently - over space. In this case, spot size, outline thickness and fill-colour are linearly swept. Can you tell what the direction-of-change is, for each of these attributes?",

    "description": "In this pattern a gradient is applied to the \"rotation\" property of a square motif. Motifs at the centre are shown at 0 degrees, whilst those at the edges are at 45 degrees. Actual positioning of the motif-centres uses a regular square grid at 45 degrees. I used my computer to supply a stream of random numbers to decide for me which of the tinier squares would be green, yellow, purple or orange. Besides rotation, two other properties of the motif follow the same radial gradient, can you see what they are (clue: one of them is a probability).\n<br>\n<br>This pattern took a long time to finish, I started it in December '16! When I realised that it was perhaps no less interesting left partially complete, I was inspired to take a lot of in-progress photos of all of the patterns I was drawing. This then provided the source material for which I created this images gallery.",

    "description": "This is my first of my compositions to combine regularly placed motifs with randomly placed motifs. Regular and random placement of motifs can be done according to some underlying low-detail design (intensity / density distribution). This is one of the core ideas of my program.\n<br>\n<br>Where a grid of dots have varing size which reveals some underlying design, this is the technique of Halftone (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone\">wikipedia article</a>). Halftone has its origin in printing, but is now used in a huge variety of modern product branding designs.\n<br>\n<br>All of these patterns are very exacting to produce by hand, and have two phases: a fine pencil drawing following by colouring in which is the more fun bit. Just as the rigid arrangement of circles in the halftone contrasts against the style of arragement of the bubbles, I have chosen bright primary colours that juxtapose a more muted, organic palette.\n<br>\n<br>The browns, greys etc. for the bubbles were randomly picked by my computer from a continuous spectrum which I specified. The blue, red and yellow of the halftone were again picked by my computer, using a discrete probability distribution with p=1/3 for each.",
